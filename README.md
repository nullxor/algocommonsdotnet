## Implementations of common Algorithms and Data Structures mainly from the MIT 6.006 OCW and the CLRS Book

### Description
Implementations in .NET of a few Algorithms and Data Structures. With a brief description of each Algorithm / Data Structure in the code comments.

### Disclaimer
These implementations are for fun / learning purposes and even though I'm trying to code the best I can, it could not be the optimum nor secure way to implement them in .NET especially thread safety.
